# StudenManagerApi – Project Description

## Overview

StudenManagerApi is a backend API project developed using ASP.NET Core Web API. It is designed following the principles of Clean Architecture and implements a layered structure including Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers. The purpose of this project is to simulate a basic student registration system using a real database such as MySQL.

This project does not include a frontend interface; it is focused solely on constructing a clean, scalable, and testable backend architecture suitable for real-world applications.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate and practice the implementation of Clean Architecture in a .NET Core Web API project. Through this project, developers will understand how to:

- Build a maintainable and testable codebase
- Structure an application using layers that align with SOLID principles
- Apply Dependency Inversion through abstractions and interfaces
- Separate concerns between business rules, application logic, infrastructure, and web concerns

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience with .NET SDK, CLI, and runtime management
- Understand and implement Clean Architecture concepts in a real API
- Apply SOLID principles, especially Dependency Inversion
- Learn how to organize a .NET solution using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- Work with mock data sources instead of a real database (for the sake of simplicity and focus on architecture)
- Learn how to inject dependencies and manage communication between layers using interfaces and services
- Get familiar with ASP.NET Core Web API’s project startup and middleware configuration
