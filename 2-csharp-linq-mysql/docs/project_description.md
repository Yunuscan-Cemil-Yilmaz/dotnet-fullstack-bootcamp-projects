# LibraryConsoleManager

## Project Description

**LibraryConsoleManager** is a C# console-based application that simulates a simple library management system.  
It allows users to add, list, update, and delete books and authors through a terminal interface.  
All data is stored and managed using a **MySQL** database with **Entity Framework Core** integration.

This project was built as part of a personal .NET learning path and emphasizes real-world programming concepts such as **OOP**, **LINQ**, **EF Core**, and clean architecture design.

## Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of:
  - Console-based input/output
  - Object-oriented programming (Classes, Properties, Methods)
  - Clean architecture (Separation of Controllers, Services, and Models)
  - LINQ operations for filtering and querying
  - Entity Framework Core with MySQL
  - Working with nullable types and null safety
  - Writing modular, testable service logic
  - Managing foreign key relationships in code-first design
